# persistent-sensor-storage
Persistent sensor storage of coupled data in database via API

Choices:
    a. Fastapi is a familiar technology that is more than sufficient for this task
    b. Uvicorn is a fast ASGI web server for Python
    c. SqlAlchemy
    d. sqlite and Postgresql as Test and Production databases

TODO:
1. Reconcile issue between pip on container and pixi
2. Stress test testing code for database performance
3. Rewrite Application Async
4. Double check on spec 

This project implements a RESTful API using FastAPI to manage project nodes and sensors. The API provides endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and connect nodes and sensors. The project is containerized with Docker for production deployment and uses Pixi for development environment management and dependency resolution.

## Prerequisites
Pixi – A fast, cross-platform package manager built atop the conda ecosystem.
Docker (optional) – For containerized deployment.
Git – To clone and manage the source code.

## Getting Started with Pixi
This application is developed with the Pixi package tool, it is recommended to use this tool here: https://pixi.sh/latest/
For the purpose of this excercise, treat pixi like a replacement for Conda
Pixi helps you set up reproducible development environments quickly. Follow these steps to get your environment ready:

1. Install Pixi
If you haven’t installed Pixi yet, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
```
This command downloads the latest Pixi binary, installs it (and updates your shell configuration), so you can run the pixi command from anywhere. You may need to restart your terminal or source your shell configuration file afterward.


2. Install Project Dependencies
Use Pixi to add all required dependencies. For example, run:

```bash
pixi install
```
Pixi will create an environment based on your manifest, generate a pixi.lock file for reproducibility, and cache all resolved packages.

3. Running the API
With your environment set up, you can run the FastAPI application using Pixi. For example:

```bash
pixi run uvicorn src.persistent_sensor_storage.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
This command launches Uvicorn to serve your FastAPI app from the Pixi-managed environment. The API will be available at http://localhost:8000, with interactive documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs.

4. Running Tests
To run the automated tests (located in the tests/ directory), execute:

```bash
pixi run pytest
```
This will run your test suite using the environment that Pixi has created.

Docker Deployment (Optional)
If you prefer a containerized setup, you can use Docker and Docker Compose:

Build and start the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
The API will be available at http://localhost:8000.
